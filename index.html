            <h5 class="card-title">About</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> I am an international student from Saudi Arabia pursuing a bachelor in Computing Science at the University of Dundee. I am someone who is deeply passionate about creating
              things. Whether it be an artistic vision or a technical solution, it's through software development that I find the tools to create them. Some of those tools are languages such as Java, C#, C, C++, Python and JavaScript. While others are API's and Frameworks such as Bootstrap and OpenGL. Whatever the task requires I am always willing and motivated to learn anything that I might need to go above and beyond. To see how I've applied those tools, take a look at some of my projects down below.</p>

            <p class="card-text">I created a basic uninformed searching system with a BFS search built in to help my teammates streamline the creation of searches required for our assignment.
            We used this system to create an AI searching program that generated every possible permuation of mandates that could be taken by a goverment to recommend a course of action, over a number of months, that would reach the specified total number of COVID-19 Cases or lower while managing a cost factor.</p>
