                deeply passionate about the tools that computation offers in creating everything from engaging experiences to unlocking new ways of thinking and approaching problems. 
                I made this site to showcase just some of the ways that I have used these tools both in the classroom and beyond.

                            <p> I joined the 84th Mini Jam that ran over a course of three days last summer. This online game jam had the goal of making a game that roughly fit the theme of bubbles but 
                                had to follow the limitation of you are your own ammo. I made a arcade styled dish cleaning minigame where the goal was to stop any dirty 
                                dishes from getting past you- but the catch is that you play as a swarm of soap bubbles that breaks down everytime a dish was cleaned. Made in 
                                Unity with all visual assets made by me within the time frame</p>
